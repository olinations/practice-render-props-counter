# Render Props Practice - Click Counter

Components can be broken down into little pieces until every Component does one thing. This however, seemed a bit tedious to me. I understand the purpose, but it seems like there must be a better way in most instances. This led me to research 'there must be a better way than render children props,' and sure enough, I found the answer and that is 'React Hooks'

So I have been studying React Hooks and will next practice an app using them, stay tuned...
