# Render Props Practice - Click Counter

Components can be broken down into little pieces until every Component does one thing. This however, seemed a bit tedious to me. I understand the purpose, but it seems like there must be a better way in most instances. This led me to research 'there must be a better way than render children props,' and sure enough, I found the answer: 'React Hooks'

So I have been studying React Hooks and will next practice an app using them, stay tuned.

It looks like React Hooks could bring React up a level. If you combine hooks with the context api, you could replace Redux. This will be my next project now that I have spent a couple days studying.
